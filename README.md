# Bank_Loan_Data_Analysis_Using_SQL_PowerBi

This project involves analyzing a bank's loan dataset using SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for data visualization. The objective is to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can help the bank make data-driven decisions regarding loan approvals, risk management, and customer profiling.

Objectives -

1. To understand the loan approval and rejection criteria.
2. To identify the key factors influencing loan defaults.
3. To analyze the demographic distribution of loan applicants.
4. To visualize trends in loan issuance over time.
5. To provide actionable insights for better loan management.

Tools and Technologies- 

1. SQL: For data extraction, cleaning, and analysis.
2. Power BI: For creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards.
3. Microsoft Excel: For initial data inspection and minor cleaning.

Data Analysis Process -

1. Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
2. Data Exploration: Understanding the data distribution, outliers, and relationships between variables using SQL.
3. Data Transformation: Creating calculated columns, aggregating data, and performing joins to enrich the dataset.
4. Data Visualization: Building interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize trends, patterns, and key metrics.

SQL Analysis -

Key SQL queries and their purpose include:

1. Loan Approval Rate: Analysis of the approval rates across different customer demographics.
2. Default Analysis: Identifying factors that contribute to loan defaults.
3. Income vs. Loan Amount: Correlation analysis between customer income and the loan amount approved.
4. Credit Score Impact: Assessing how credit scores affect loan approval chances.

Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides visual insights into the following areas:

1. Loan Status Overview: A summary of approved, rejected, and defaulted loans.
2. Demographic Analysis: Distribution of loan applicants by age, income, and employment status.
3. Credit Score Impact: Visualization of loan approvals based on credit score ranges.
4. Trends Over Time: Monthly and yearly trends in loan issuance.

Key Insights
1. Approval Trends: Higher loan approval rates are observed among applicants with stable employment and high credit scores.
2. Default Factors: Default rates are significantly higher among lower-income groups and applicants with lower credit scores.
3. Income Disparity: A clear disparity in loan amounts issued based on customer income levels.
